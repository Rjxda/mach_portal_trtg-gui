To setup this project, all you have to do is the following:
1.Change the GROUP ID of the project to the following format:"com.(yourname).mach-portal".
2.Change the team to your own (right below Group ID)
3.Go to Capabilities>App Groups and add your own in the following format:"group.(yourname).mach_portal".
4.Now, navigate to jailbreak.c, and change "App Group" to the App Group you just set.
5.Make sure your Apple ID is linked to Xcode.
6.Plug in your iDevice.
7.Click run, AKA the play button in the top left of Xcode.
8.Wait for Xcode to tell you that you need to trust a Provisioning Profile, and go to Settings>General>Profiles and Device Management, your Apple ID, and click the blue trust button.
9.Go to Settings>Wifi, and connect to a Wifi. Once done, click the blue "i" next to your device and write down the IP Address.
10.Click the play button once again, and let Xcode do its thing. The app should open.
11.DO NOT CLOSE THE APP! If the device reboots, just try again.
12.If the app doesn't close, open terminal, and type in nc (iPhoneIP) 4141. You should get a full file browser within terminal. To list directories, type ls, and to open them, type cd (directory name).
13.To download files, open an internet browser such as chrome, and type in the following Address: http://(iPhoneIP):8081. You should get a form with a download button.
14.To download a certain file, use the terminal browser to find the full path of a file, including the file. For example, if I wanted the kernelcache, I could type /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache into the form and click download.
15.And that's all! Enjoy!

# mach_portal-gui
A GUI for the mach_portal app made by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.

Also gathered a few other features from r/jailbreak, such as all offsets for 64-bit devices and the ability to connect over html instead of just terminal. Credit to the owners has already been given in the respected modified files.

I do not take credit for ANYTHING in this app except for the app's GUI. Everything else, such as the offsets and html ability, were just downloaded and put into the project. To modify/compile the project yourself, open the xcode.proj with Xcode 8.x on a Mac.

There are three versions of the app: iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPad. The iPhone 5s is for any 64-bit device with the iPhone 5s-sized display, such as the iPhone SE. The iPhone 6 version is for the iPhone 6 and above. Lastly, the iPad version is for all iPads.

Enjoy!

P.S. If you need help on setting up this project, open SETTINGUP.txt in the repository.

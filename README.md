# mach_portal_trtg-gui
A GUI for the mach_portal app made by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero.

Also gathered a few other features from r/jailbreak, such as all offsets for 64-bit devices and the ability to connect over html instead of just terminal. I've also added a cool AppIcon for mach_portal (which is also from r/jailbreak). Credit to the owners has already been given in the respected modified files.

I do not take credit for ANYTHING in this app except for the app's GUI. Everything else, such as the offsets and html ability, were just downloaded and put into the project. To modify/compile the project yourself, open the mach_portal.xcodeproj with Xcode 8.x on a Mac.

There is one version for all devices, which is in the mach_portal folder. There is also an iPA, but it seems to not work according to my testing. (You can sideload it with Cydia Impactor if you want to give it a try.) 

Enjoy!

P.S. If you need help on setting up this project, open SETTINGUP.txt in the repository.
